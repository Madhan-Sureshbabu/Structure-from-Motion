# Structure from Motion

 - This project implements a bundle adjustment framework to find the optimal camera poses and 3D point positions.

 - [Bundle Adjustment in the Large - BAL Dataset](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/bal/) has been used to test the code.

## Project Pipeline
 
 - The data of 2D point positions in different camera frames are read using the BALProblem class defined(?) in common.cpp, and normalized and perturbed. <br />
 - The optimization has been implemented using both g2o and Ceres. With g2o, graph vertices are created for each point and camera pose to be estimated from the given data. <br />
 - Then g2o edges are added between pairs of 3D point and camera pose vertices that produce a measurement that was recorded in the dataset. A reprojection error function is also defined in the g2o edge class. <br />
 - With Ceres, the required residual block template class is defined in SnavelyReprojectionError.h which also holds / which is also the functor that calculates the jacobian directly through auto differentiation. <br />
 - Levenbergâ€“Marquardt optimization algorithm has been set up to perform the estimation. Also due to the large scale of the problem, Schur elimination has been utilized to marginalize the landmark positions and accelerate the calculation of the solution to the normal equation.
